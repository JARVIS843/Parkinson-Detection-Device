# Parkinson Detection Device

## Overview
This project is a prototype of a device that can detect Parkinson's disease using a combination of hardware and software. The device uses an accelerometer to measure the tremors of the hand and a microcontroller to process the data and determine if the tremors are indicative of Parkinson's disease. The device is designed to be portable and easy to use, making it accessible for patients and healthcare professionals. This project is supposed to be the final project for the Introduction to Embedded Systems course.
## Features
- Real-time tremor detection using an accelerometer and gyroscope
- Data processing and analysis using advanced FFT algorithms
- User-friendly interface for displaying results and providing feedback
- Portable design for easy use in various settings
- Open-source hardware and software for community collaboration and improvement
## Hardware Components
